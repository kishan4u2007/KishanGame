Prototypes in JS
-------------------------
A Javascript objefct is an entity having state and behaviour (properties and method).
JS objects have a special property called prototype.
we can set prototype using __proto__

*if object & prototype have same method,
object's method will be used.



Class in JS
-----------------
class is a program-code template for creating obects.

Those object will have some state(variables) & some behaviour (function) inside it


Inheritance in JS
---------------------
inheritance is passing down properties & method from parent class to child class

*if Child and Parent have same method, child's method will be used.[Method Overriding]


Super Keyword
--------------------
The super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods.

super(args) // calls parent's constructor

super.parentMethod(arg)

Sync in JS
---------------------

synchronous : 
Synchronous means the code runs in partiucluar sequence of instructions given in the program.
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

Asynchronous: 
Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which
causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronous code execution allow to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.
