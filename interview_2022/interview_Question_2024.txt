What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

null is an assignment value representing the absence of any object value, whereas undefined means a variable has been declared but 
has not yet been assigned a value.

Explain the concept of event delegation in JavaScript.

Event delegation is a technique where you attach an event listener to a parent element instead of multiple child elements. 
Events that occur on the child elements are then handled by the parent. This can improve performance and reduce memory consumption, 
especially when dealing with a large number of elements.

What are the new features introduced in ES6?

ES6 introduced several new features such as arrow functions, template literals, let and const keywords for variable declarations, 
classes, destructuring assignment, and the spread/rest operator, among others.

What is the box model in CSS?

The CSS box model describes the layout and rendering of elements on a web page. It consists of content, padding, border, and margin. 
The width and height of an element are calculated as the sum of its content, padding, and border, with the margin extending beyond that.

Explain the difference between inline, block, and inline-block display properties in CSS.

inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. block elements start on a new line and 
take up the full width available. inline-block elements are similar to inline elements but they can have a width and height, and 
they respect top and bottom margins and padding.

What is responsive web design?

Responsive web design is an approach to designing and coding websites to ensure that they provide an optimal viewing and interaction 
experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

How does CSS specificity work?

CSS specificity determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple conflicting styles are defined. 
It is calculated based on the type of selector used (ID, class, element), with IDs having the highest specificity,
 followed by classes, and then element selectors.

What is the purpose of a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less?

CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less extend the functionality of CSS by allowing variables, nesting, mixins, and functions. 
This makes CSS code more maintainable, modular, and reusable.

Explain the concept of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

CORS is a security feature implemented by browsers that controls access to resources on a different origin (domain). 
It allows servers to specify who can access their resources, preventing unauthorized access from web pages hosted on other domains.

What are some optimization techniques you can use to improve website performance?

Optimization techniques include minimizing HTTP requests, combining and minifying CSS and JavaScript files, 
using asynchronous loading for scripts, optimizing images, leveraging browser caching, and utilizing content delivery networks (CDNs).

Frontend (React):


What are the key features of React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its key features include virtual DOM for efficient rendering, 
component-based architecture for reusability, JSX syntax for combining JavaScript and HTML, and uni-directional data flow 
with Flux/Redux for managing state.

Explain the concept of state and props in React.

State represents the internal data of a component that can change over time. Props (short for properties) are immutable data passed 
from parent to child components, used to customize and configure child components.

What is JSX in React?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. 
It simplifies the creation of React elements and makes the code more readable.

What is the difference between functional and class components in React?

Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that take props as input and return React elements. 
Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and have additional features such as state and lifecycle methods.

Explain the purpose of React hooks.

React hooks are functions that enable functional components to use state and other React features without writing a class. 
They allow you to use state and side-effects in functional components, making them more flexible and easier to understand.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript for both 
frontend and backend development, enabling full-stack JavaScript development. Node.js is popular for its non-blocking, 
event-driven architecture, which makes it lightweight, efficient, and scalable for building real-time applications.

Explain the event loop in Node.js.

The event loop is a fundamental concept in Node.js that allows it to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking. 
It continuously checks the call stack for new tasks and executes them asynchronously, ensuring that Node.js remains responsive 
and efficient.

What is npm and what is its role in Node.js development?

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install, manage, and share reusable 
JavaScript code packages (modules) from the npm registry. npm simplifies dependency management and allows developers to 
leverage a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools.


What are callbacks in Node.js? How do they help with asynchronous programming?

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed once the operation is completed. In Node.js, 
are commonly used for asynchronous operations such as reading files or making HTTP requests. They help with asynchronous programming 
by allowing code execution to continue while waiting for I/O operations to complete, thus avoiding blocking the event loop.


What is Express.js and how does it relate to Node.js?

Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features for building web servers and 
APIs, including routing, middleware, and template engines. Express.js simplifies the process of building web applications in 
Node.js by providing a lightweight, flexible, and unopinionated framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.


*****************************************************************************

Frontend (General):

What is the Document Object Model (DOM) and how does it relate to web development?

The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of HTML and XML documents as a 
tree of nodes, allowing JavaScript to manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically.

What are the differences between == and === in JavaScript?

== is the equality operator that performs type coercion if the operands are of different types, while === is the 
strict equality operator that checks both value and type without coercion.


Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.

Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope 
during the compilation phase, regardless of where they are declared within the scope.

What is event bubbling and event capturing in JavaScript?

Event bubbling is the process where an event triggered on a nested element propagates upwards through 
its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy. Event capturing is the opposite process, where the event is captured at 
the highest level of the DOM hierarchy and then propagates downwards to the target element.


What are closures in JavaScript and how are they used?

Closures are functions that retain access to variables from their containing lexical scope even after 
the scope has closed. They are commonly used to create private variables and encapsulate functionality in JavaScript.
Backend (General):

What is RESTful API and how does it work?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. 
A RESTful API uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, and 
it follows the principles of statelessness, uniform interface, and resource-based URLs.


Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.

SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas, while NoSQL databases are 
non-relational databases that store data in flexible, schema-less formats like JSON or BSON documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.

What is middleware in the context of web development?

Middleware is software that sits between an application's operating system and the applications it supports. 
In web development, middleware functions are used to modify or intercept requests and responses in an HTTP pipeline, 
enabling additional features like authentication, logging, or error handling.


What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?

Synchronous programming executes code sequentially, blocking further execution until the current operation is completed, 
while asynchronous programming allows multiple operations to be executed concurrently, without blocking the main thread of execution.

What is the purpose of a package manager like npm or Yarn?

Package managers like npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn are used to automate the process of installing, updating, and 
managing dependencies for software projects. They simplify dependency management and help ensure that all project collaborators 
are using the same versions of libraries and tools.


React:

What are the key differences between stateful and stateless components in React?

Stateful components (also known as class components) have their own internal state managed by React, 
while stateless components (also known as functional components) receive data via props and do not have internal state.

What is the significance of keys in React lists?

Keys are special attributes used by React to identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed in a list. 
They help React efficiently update the UI by minimizing re-renders and improving performance.

Explain the purpose of React Router and how it works.

React Router is a popular library for declaratively defining routes in React applications. 
It allows developers to create single-page applications with multiple views by mapping URLs to components and 
managing navigation state.


What are React hooks and why were they introduced?

React hooks are functions that enable functional components to use state and other React features without writing a class. 
They were introduced in React 16.8 to simplify state management and make it easier to reuse logic across components.


How does React handle prop drilling and what are some techniques to avoid it?

Prop drilling occurs when props need to be passed through multiple layers of components. 
To avoid prop drilling, you can use techniques like context API, custom hooks, or state management libraries like Redux.



Node.js:

What is the difference between require() and import in Node.js?

require() is a commonJS module system used in Node.js to import modules, while import is an ES6 module syntax that allows 
for more flexible and dynamic imports. Node.js supports both require() and import, but import requires the use of the .mjs file
 extension or the "type": "module" field in package.json.


Explain the role of the fs module in Node.js.

The fs module in Node.js provides file system operations such as reading, writing, and manipulating files and directories. 
It allows developers to work with the file system in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner using callbacks or promises.


What is the purpose of the process object in Node.js?

The process object in Node.js provides information and control over the current Node.js process. It allows developers to access 
environment variables, command-line arguments, and other process-related information, as well as control process lifecycle events 
like exiting or terminating the process.


How does error handling work in Node.js?

Error handling in Node.js can be done using try-catch blocks for synchronous code or by using callback functions with error-first 
parameters for asynchronous code. Additionally, Node.js provides the process.on('uncaughtException') event handler to catch unhandled 
exceptions and prevent the Node.js process from crashing.


Explain the concept of streams in Node.js and how they can be used.

Streams in Node.js are objects used to read or write data sequentially, allowing for efficient processing of large datasets or 
continuous data streams. They can be used for file I/O, network communication, and data transformation tasks, and they provide 
a memory-efficient way to handle data.
